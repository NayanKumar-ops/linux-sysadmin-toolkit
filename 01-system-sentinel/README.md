## 01 – System Sentinel

System Sentinel is a Linux monitoring project designed to practice
how system administrators **observe, log, and respond** to common
system issues.

The focus is operational thinking — not just commands.

---

## Goals
- Monitor system health signals
- Log incidents safely
- Apply controlled recovery actions
- Capture system snapshots for analysis

---

## Subproject: Sentinel-Watchdog

Sentinel-Watchdog is a Bash-based watchdog script that runs manually
or via cron to inspect system and security conditions.
